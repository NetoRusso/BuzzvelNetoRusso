__________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________

<p>I developed a custom landing page to demonstrate my skills and enthusiasm for being part of the Buzzvel team. The project, built with React.js and optimized for SEO, presents an interactive portfolio with my main work, including projects aligned with Buzzvel's objectives. Through animations and a responsive design, the microsite offers an immersive and intuitive experience, making it easier to navigate and understand my profile. Additionally, I've included a detailed roadmap that demonstrates how my skills and goals fit perfectly into Buzzvel's growth. I am sure that my experience and passion for web development can add great value to the team.</p>

<h3>Requirements</h3>

 - <h4> Required Features: </h4>
 
	- Implement proper meta tags for the page title, description, and keywords.
	- Use semantic HTML tags (e.g., header, main, article, section, footer).
	- For Next.js, utilize server-side rendering (SSR) or static site generation  (SSG) to improve SEO performance.
	- Include alt text for images and ensure proper heading structure (e.g., h1, h2, h3).
	- Implement Open Graph (OG) tags for better social media sharing.

- 	Responsive Design:
	- Ensure that the entire microsite is fully responsive, providing an optimal
viewing experience across different devices (mobile, tablet, desktop).
	- Use flexible layouts, media queries, and responsive units (e.g., em, rem,
percentages) to ensure elements adjust correctly on various screen sizes.

- Animations:
	- CSS3 Animations: Use CSS3 for simple animations like fading, sliding, or
hover effects. We'll like it if you use framer-motion.
	- GSAP (GreenSock Animation Platform): For more complex animations
such as scroll-triggered effects, text reveals, or dynamic transitions.
	- React Native Animations: If using React Native, leverage its built-in
Animated API or libraries like react-native-reanimated for smooth and
performant animations on mobile devices.	

Note: You can use others animations if you're more familiar with.

 - <h4> Technology Options: </h4>
		

	 - React: Use React to build a single-page application (SPA) with a   
   focus on component reusability and SEO optimization using techniques 
   like react-helmet.
	- Next.js: Leverage Next.js for server-side rendering (SSR), static site generation
(SSG), and improved SEO performance out of the box. Perfect for a site that needs
fast loading times and better search engine visibility.
	- React Native: If you prefer a mobile-first approach, create a similar experience
optimized for mobile devices. Ensure animations and responsiveness are tailored
to mobile use.

 - <h4> Evaluation Criteria: </h4>

	 - Design & UX: The design should be aesthetically pleasing and user-friendly,
with animations enhancing the experience. Responsiveness across devices is
crucial.
	- Technical Implementation: Your use of React, Next.js, or React Native will
be evaluated, along with your ability to integrate animations effectively and
implement SEO best practices.
	- Creativity & Communication: Your creativity in presenting your experience
and motivations will be assessed. Animations should highlight key content
without overwhelming the user.
	- Performance & SEO: The site’s loading speed, responsiveness, and SEO
optimization (e.g., proper use of meta tags, semantic HTML, fast rendering)
will be checked.
	- Attention to Detail: The project should demonstrate a comprehensive
approach, with careful attention paid to both technical and design aspects.
